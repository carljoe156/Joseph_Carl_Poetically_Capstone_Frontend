              While writing from the heart is almost always the best approach
              when writing poetry, sometimes inspiration is hard to come by. If
              you are not sure what to write about but know that you want to
              write something, you are in the right place! Let’s take a look at
              where you can find inspiration to create your best work yet.

              1. Read Poetry
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you are struggling to find the perfect topic for your next
              poem, why not pick up someone else’s work? With so many incredible
              writers in the world tackling all manner of topics from very
              diverse perspectives, you are doing yourself a disservice when you
              ignore other work. In fact, a well-read author is a better writer,
              and expanding your horizons can have an incredible impact on your
              ability.
            </p>

            <p>
              To get started, think about what is important to you. What are you
              interested in? Think of topics about which you are passionate and
              start looking for poetry about them. Chances are good you will be
              able to find a match, and the words might just inspire you to
              create your own poetry in the future.
            </p>

              2. Pick an Emotion
            </h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes you can find inspiration simply by examining your own
              emotions. Poetry is particularly well-suited for this, too, with
              many people considering poetry therapy to help them deal with
              their mental health or emotional health struggles. Simply pick an
              emotion and think about the last time you felt that way. What
              happened and how did it affect you? Is there something happening
              right now in your life that you just need to voice? Follow these
              emotions and try to write something about it.
            </p>

              3. Write to Someone Else
            </h2>
            <p>
              Another way to kick start your creative juices is to dedicate the
              poem to someone else. If you are writing a poem for your mother,
              for example, you will probably think about the various ways in
              which she has inspired you over the years. This is a great way to
              start creating an incredible poem and even consider giving it to
              her as a gift.

              4. Browse the Internet
            </h2>
            <p>
              Another source of inspiration is the internet. Simply log on to
              social media and see what catches your eye. Whether you draw
              inspiration from the good or the bad, the internet is full of
              potential topics to tackle. You might also consider running a
              picture or art search, too, and looking through the results for
              inspiration.

              5. Listen to Music
            </h2>
            <p>
              Along with images, music is one of the great motivators of
              humanity. Art transcends culture and time to create something that
              evokes emotion in everyone. With the best music able to stir
              thoughts and emotions just as well today as it did hundreds of
              years ago. With that in mind, why not listen to some music to find
              inspiration?

              6. Go for a Walk
            </h2>
            <p>
              Get out of the house and occupy your mind with something simple by
              taking a walk. You do not have to go far – just taking a quick
              jaunt through the park or even around the block can do wonders for
              your creativity and focus. Not to mention the fact that you might
              come across something that evokes emotion or memories that spur
              the words you seek.
