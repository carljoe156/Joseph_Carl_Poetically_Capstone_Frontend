            How to Prepare the Perfect Space to Write
          </h1>

              We all know that the perfect writing space can inspire. There’s
              comfort and security there that allows us to be more vulnerable in
              our writing. It can be quiet. Away from the kids or noisy
              neighbors. It can be serene. It can be anything you want it to be.
            </p>

            <p>
              Luckily, it is entirely possible to write incredible poetry from
              just about anywhere in the world, much less anywhere in your home,
              and an HGTV-star designed office is not required.
            </p>

              Pick the Right Room
            </h2>
            <p>
              Picking the right room establishes it as your space. It’s
              dedicated to you and what you enjoy doing. Thomas Edison used to
              go into a dedicated room in his house where he would sit for hours
              undisturbed and simply write down ideas, even expand on them.
            </p>

            <p>
              It doesn’t necessarily have to be a dedicated office-type room,
              either, but rather a room that is most conducive to getting your
              creative juices flowing without taking away from the rest of your
              responsibilities. If you have children, for example, the natural
              choice might be to write in a room as far away from their noise as
              possible. As most parents know, however, kids can get into quite a
              bit of trouble when left to their own devices, so finding a good
              spot somewhere where you can keep an eye on them is probably the
              best bet.

              The Right Decor
            </h2>
            <p>
              Decor can be inspiring every time you look at it. Now that you
              found your space, it’s important that as a writer you surround
              yourself with things that make you feel something – happy, warm,
              love, joy, confidence, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe it’s fuzzy pillows or the sign you found on a trip that
              reminds you that “Worrying is like sitting in a rocking chair. It
              gives you something to do but it doesn’t get you anywhere.” Photos
              of friends and loved ones, cutouts of places you want to travel to
              – really anything that makes you comfortable and feel something
              good.
            </p>

              Pick the Right Space
            </h2>
            <p>
              Do not worry – even if you do not live in a home with extra rooms,
              you can find a good space in which to write. Whether you live in a
              studio or have roommates and cannot take up much of the common
              spaces, it is possible to create a perfect place to write your
              poetry, and it doesn’t have to be at home. To begin, ask yourself
              a few questions.
            </p>

              Shed Some Light on It
            </h2>
            <p>
              Once you have found the perfect space for your poetry retreat, it
              is time to decorate it in a way that is conducive to writing.
              Lighting is a big part of this for many people. Do you appreciate
              cool daylight or cozier, warmer hues? The good news is that there
              is an abundance of affordable lighting options for both cool and
              warm lighting. Find some lighting that works for you and set it up
              where you’ll be writing.

              Organize Your Supplies
            </h2>
            <p>
              Whether you choose to write on a laptop, pen to paper, or in that
              beautiful journal you splurged on, you need to make sure that all
              of your writing supplies are nearby. Every time you get up in the
              middle of a project, it can take 15-20 minutes to get that train
              of thinking back in line. Set up your space with everything you
              need and make the most of the time you have available to write.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 text-center">
              Be Honest with Loved Ones
            </h2>
            <p>
              One of the biggest components of an ideal writing space is loved
              ones who understand. Be honest with your family and friends and
              ask them not to strike up random conversations when you are
              writing, if possible, so that you can focus on your craft.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, remember that writing should be relaxing no matter where
              you do it. There is a reason people consider writing and poetry as
              therapy. It can calm your mind and improve your mood.
