              Every poem begins with a blank page—a space full of possibility.
              It might seem daunting, but remember that the greatest works of
              art were once just an empty canvas, waiting for their creator’s
              touch.
            </p>

            <p>
              The beauty of writing is that it’s never about perfection. It’s
              about showing up, putting pen to paper, and letting your thoughts
              flow. Even if the words don’t come out the way you envisioned,
              every line you write is a step forward on your creative journey.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, don’t fear the blank page. Embrace it. It holds endless
              potential, and the best part is, it’s yours to fill. Let your
              imagination guide you, and trust that the words will follow.
            </p>

            <p>Keep writing. Your voice is waiting to be heard.</p>
